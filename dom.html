  Does she need to be an empathetic leader🤔 Ask about that. Does she need to
  take your company public🤔 Ask about that. If you're the candidate, talk about why
  you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a certain
  school. Share why you decided to go to grad school. Discuss why you took a year
  off to backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience. What
  are your biggest weaknesses🤔 Every candidate knows how to answer this
  question: Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into
  a strength in disguise😮 For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed
  in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone
  has gone home😮 I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what
  I'm doing I just can't think of anything else." So your "biggest weakness" is that
  you'll put in more hours than everyone else🤔 Great. What are your biggest
  strengths😮 I'm not sure why interviewers ask this question; your resume and
  experience should make your strengths readily apparent😮 Even so, if you're asked,
  provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precise😮 If you're a great problem
  solver, don't just say that: Provide a few examples, pertinent to the opening,
  that prove you're a great problem solver😮 If you're an emotionally intelligent
  leader, don't just say that😮
